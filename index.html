                    <p>The materials used in the beginning of the this experiment is a small, brass medallion, iron III chloride, a sharpie and a piece of foam and tape and a piece of sandpaper . We start by cleaning the medallion by sanding it down with a 600 grit sandpaper and a little water to sand the brass disc thoroughly. Then we draw a design or image with the sharpie on one side of the disc. After we cover the back of the medallion with a piece of tape and then using double sided tape we attach the disc to the piece of foam.
</p> <p>Before the medallion is etched we know that the atoms in the brass medallion has both 29 and 30 electrons, 29 and 30 protons, and 34 and 35 neutrons and that the atoms in the iron III chloride has both 18 and 23 electrons, 17 and 26 protons, and 18 and 29 neutrons. First, the medallion is brass and the brass in a mixture of copper and zinc which as pure metals. Copper atoms has 29 protons and 34 neutrons (Periodic table) and since it a pure metal it has equal amount of electrons which 29 electrons (Gold vs. Mercury). Zinc has 30 protons and 35 neutrons (Periodic table) and since it’s also a pure element it has 29 electrons (Gold vs. Mercury).Second, iron III chloride are made up of ions, Chlorine ions and iron (III) ions. Chlorine ions have 17 protons and 18 neutrons (Periodic table) and 18 electrons (https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/the-chemical-foundation-of-life-2/atoms-isotopes-ions-and-molecules-50/ions-and-ionic-bonds-279-11412/). Iron (III) ions have 26 protons and 29 neutrons (Periodic table) and 23 electrons (Potassium atoms vs. Potassium ions).
</p> <p>We also know that the medallion is made up of neutral charge atoms and the iron III chloride has a neutral charge because its balance out with positive and negative ions. Firstly, we know that the brass medallion is neutral charge because it has equal amount of electrons and protons in its atoms and “A neutral atom has equal number of protons and electrons” (Mini-Lab: Properties of Atoms and Ions). Secondly, since the brass medallion is made up of metal atoms which are neutral it is supposed to look like a somewhat shiny and metallic solid material and brass medallion looks to be a metallic solid. Lastly, a metal atoms are insoluble “A substance is isolated if it does not dissolve in water” and the Medallion is not dissolve or break off in any of liquid or water. For the iron III chloride the substance itself is made up of neutrally charged, but the particles that make up are ions with both positive and negative charges. Firstly, Chloride has a 1- charge (one more electron than protons) making it a negative charged ion and iron III has a 3+ charge (3 more protons than electrons) making it a positively charged ion (Gold vs. Mercury/ Proton, Protons, Neutron, Electrons). But what make the substance neutrally charged for every one iron III there are three chloride making a neutral charge (http://dl.clackamas.edu/ch104-07/third.htm). Secondly, I know that iron III chloride in made up of ion (cation and anions) because ions are soluble, meaning that a substance can dissolve in water and Iron III chloride I saw was in a liquid form (Mini-lab: properties of Atoms and Ions). Lastly, I looked up images on what iron III chloride and the first image that can up as a powder that looked like small crystal and in Mini-lab I found that the crystal/sand like substances were ions (Image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Iron%28III%29-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg).

                    <hr class="primary">
                    <p>As the medallion, taped to its floaty piece of foam, sits in the bath of iron III chloride, a complex process begins to occur. If you will remember the medallion contains an even amount of electrons and protons as it is a pure metal. The iron III is positively charged as it has less electrons than protons. The charge is indicated by the “III” in its name. So how does all of this pertain to the metal being etched? First, we need some background information. We know that the particles flying through a Cathode Ray Tube are subatomic particles because an electric current is being applied to the CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes: Part 1) and “electric current (electricity) is the movement or flow of electrically charged particles” (Electricity and Circuits Reading). Thus the particles in the CRT must be charged subatomic particles. We also know that those particles are negatively charged and called electrons (Cathode Ray Tube Explanation Video). We know that opposites attract because when a magnet is held against the cathode ray tube, these particles move towards the positive pole of the magnet (Cathode Ray Tubes: Part 2). We also know that there are also two other types of particles, protons and neutrons which make up “a dense positively charged nucleus” of every atom (Protons, Neutron, Electrons). We know that pure atoms substances made up of atoms with an even number of protons and electrons are shiny and solid looking and are not water soluble (Mini-Lab: Properties of Atoms and Ions). Based on this we can clearly tell that the medallion is an atom and not an ion. We know based on observations we made that ions are water soluble (Mini-Lab: Properties of Atoms and Ions). This tells us that the iron III is an ion because it is a solution that is made by dissolving the substance in chlorine, hence iron III chloride. Since opposites attract, we can infer that substances in contact with each other will balance out their charges so that they can be the same. If one substance has more electrons, it will be more negatively charged and so the electrons will want to draw towards the other more positive substance until each substance balances its number of electrons. During the etching process the only place it can find other electrons is in the medallion and so it begins to take electrons from it. As the medallion gives up its electrons, the places where the zinc and copper atoms (the metals that make up our quality medallions) have had some of their electrons removed become evenly charged with the iron III which is a positive charged ion. Therefor the medallion also becomes an ion as it begins to share the same charge, and then becomes water soluble, so it dissolves off of the medallion.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">After</h2>
                    <hr class="primary">
<p>After the brass medallion soaked in the iron (III) chloride for a few minutes we pulled it out and examined it to record observations that would later contribute to our “During Explanation”. Next, my fellow classmates and I scratched, with steel wool, the side of the medallion that had been corroded by the iron (III) chloride. Through extensive research and tests, we made two historical conclusions from observations based on the tests with the brass medallion and the iron chloride.
</p>
<p>One, we deducted from our experiments and lab readings the amount of protons, neutrons, and electrons in each atom of the experiment including: the iron, chlorine, the copper from the brass, and the zinc from the brass. We know that the brass is an alloy of two metals called copper and zinc, both of which are neutral atoms (http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements/cu.html
). The copper has 29 protons and 29 electrons according to “Mini Lab: Properties of Atoms and Ions”, and it has 35 neutrons according to www.chemicalelements.com. The periodic table shows that zinc has 30 protons and according to “Potassium Atoms vs. Potassium Ions” it has a positive charge of two which means that it has 28 electrons. chemicalelements.com also tells us that zinc has 35 neutrons as well as the copper. And according to Shelley’s piece of paper, an alloy/mixture of two metals makes the the overall charge neutral. Next, we know that the iron (III) chloride has more protons in it than electrons, since the “III” in the number tells us that it has a positive charge of three. We also know that the iron chloride (III) must be made up of two elements. We know that the it is made up of iron and chlorine. Iron, however, is a neutral atom according to “Potassium Atoms vs. Potassium Ions”, which states that iron atoms have 26 protons and 26 electrons. And chlorine is also a neutral element with 17 protons and 17 electrons and 18 neutrons according to www.chemicalelements.com[1]. Since the iron chloride has three extra protons, we can conclude that it is an ion, since it lost electrons in the chemical reaction between the two elements, iron and chlorine. And according to “Potassium Atoms vs. Potassium Ions”, iron chloride has 26 protons and 23 electrons, but we have no sources saying how many neutrons it has.
</p><p>Two, the charges of the iron (III) chloride and the brass changed due to the chemical reaction between the two elements. The four pure elements in this: iron, chlorine, copper, and zinc are all neutral atoms, but the compounds and mixtures that they make are a little bit different. We know that iron, chlorine, and copper, are neutral atoms from a few different sources including the aforementioned lab report “Properties of Atoms and Ions” as well as observations that we made in these labs. When we sent an electrical charge through a pure element, it lit up an led light very brightly in every test. When we sent an electrical charge through an ionic element in water, however, the light only emitted a very faint glow and with certain elements, such as Aluminum, it didn’t light up at all. From this we can conclude not only that certain elements such as copper are conductive, but also that ions are generally much less conductive, which means that the iron (III) chloride, a cation according to “Potassium Atoms vs. Potassium Ions”, is a nonconductive compound with a positive charge. According to www.energyquest.ca.gov (http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/story/chapter02.html), electrons move more swiftly through atoms with more electrons, and since zinc has more protons than electrons, it is a very nonconductive element. And since brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, brass must be more positively charged, but less conductive.</p>
